# TODO

Follow-ups recommended after a change landed, so they are not lost between releases. Each item
names the note that explains the background.

## Open

- **Opt-in `<allowed_hosts>` for embedded HTTP calls.** The 1.6.0 escaping fix stops a *caller*
  from steering an `{http{ … }http}` block to another host, but a configuration author is still
  trusted to pick any host and there is no private-range block. An opt-in allow-list of
  destination hosts (global, overridable per endpoint) would close that. Background:
  [SECURITY_HARDENING_1.6.md](SECURITY_HARDENING_1.6.md), section 1, "Not done, and why".

- **An upload with an invalid file name returns an empty 500.** `ValidateAndGetNormalizeFileName`
  throws `ArgumentException` (for example for `a\b.txt` on Windows), and nothing above it turns
  that into a 400 with a message the caller can act on. Background:
  [ParametersBuilder.cs](DBToRestAPI/Services/ParametersBuilder.cs), `ValidateAndGetNormalizeFileName`.

## Done

- **Keep a download's `relative_path` inside its store.** Shipped in 1.7.2. Before, the path a
  download query returned was joined to the store's `base_path` unchecked, so `..`, an absolute
  path, or on Windows a UNC or device path (`\\host\share\...`, `\??\UNC\...`) read any file the
  app's account could reach, on that machine or another one. Local and SFTP stores now refuse
  anything outside `base_path` with the same 404 as a missing file, and neither 404 echoes the
  resolved path any more. A local store without a `base_path` no longer falls back to the app's
  own folder. The upload side got the same check, and on Linux a file name containing `\` can
  no longer turn into a path outside the store. See
  [FileStorePath.cs](DBToRestAPI/Services/FileStorePath.cs) and
  [docs/topics/10-file-downloads.md](docs/topics/10-file-downloads.md).

- **SFTP uploads failed for every new file.** Fixed in Com.H.Net.Ssh 10.1.1, which 1.7.2
  references. In 10.1.0, `SFtpClient.Exists` and `ExistsAsync` threw `SftpPathNotFoundException`
  for a missing path instead of returning false, so the existence check that runs before each
  SFTP upload (with the default `overwrite_existing_files=false`) failed on every new file.

- **OpenAPI `429` annotation for rate-limited operations.** Shipped in 1.7.0 together with the
  rate-limiting feature itself. See [docs/topics/18-rate-limiting.md](docs/topics/18-rate-limiting.md)
  and [docs/topics/20-openapi.md](docs/topics/20-openapi.md).
